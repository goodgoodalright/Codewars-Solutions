        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Born as Yamada Jun in the Nishi-Azabu district of Minato in central Tokyo, Japan, Seba Jun developed a love for jazz and hip-hop as he came of age. In cultivating his lifelong passion for music, he owned T Records and Guinness Records in Shibuya before adopting a stage name - a reversed portmanteau of his real name - and founding the Hydeout Productions record label.</p>
        <p>As he approached the height of an already sparkling career, Seba was in a traffic collision exiting the Shuto Expressway one night soon after his thirty-sixth birthday. Attempts to revive him failed; he now rests in Tama Cemetery.</p>
        <p>His legacy lives on, having reached millions of fans across the world and inspired countless artists - myself included - to eke out the sounds of their souls onto strings, drums, horns, and microphones.</p>
        <p class="right">To quote Gus Navarro, co-founder of <cite><a href="https://bonuscut.com/2014/01/15/album-of-the-week-modal-soul-by-nujabes/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">BonusCut</a></cite>:
          <blockquote>"The music of late producer Nujabes is something to hold onto and never let go... On <em class="italic">Modal Soul</em> it's as if you can hear Nujabes speaking to the audience through his music. He was feeling a certain way when he made each track and that comes crashing through in each song. There are moments of pure bliss and also times where it feels that tears are necessary. Nujabes has created something that is hard to categorize due to the range of emotion, musicality, and purpose that clearly went into each individual track. The beauty in this record is that Nujabes was speaking from the heart."</blockquote>
        </p>

        <h3 id="career">Career</h3>
        <p>Hailed as the 'godfather of lo-fi hip-hop', Nujabes was a Japanese record producer, audio engineer, composer, arranger, DJ, and founder of Hydeout Productions. Despite his many collaborations with artists from Japan and America, many of his works remain as instrumentals both by design and his untimely passing.</p>
        <p>Best known for his contributions to the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Samurai_Champloo" target="_blank" class="italic">Samurai Champloo</a> soundtrack, he only released two albums during his lifetime: <em class="italic">Metaphorical Music</em> and <em>Modal Soul</em>, both of which feature artists from his label. His style and technique are often mentioned alongside <a href="#" target="_blank" class="italic">J Dilla</a> - another legendary late beatmaker - and blend aspects of trip hop, breakbeat, downtempo, and ambient music with samples of hip-hop, soul, and jazz.</p>
        <p>His friends and fellow artists shine in a beautiful synergy of heartfelt, tastefully simple beats and the kind of fire on the mic that makes you happy to be alive. Local artists like Shing02, Uyama Hiroto, Minmi, and L-Universe can be heard on his earliest compilations alongside underground American hip-hop acts like Fat Jon, CYNE, Cise Starr (of CYNE fame), Apani B, CL Smooth, Substantial, Emancipator, Terry Callier, and even the British rapper Funky DL.
